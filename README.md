# GlobalGameJamGame

I did the coding for this game. The Assets were made by 2 of my friends at University back in 2019
I do wish to go back and look at this project again to edit it for Unreal engine when I feel completely comfortable with the engine

Everything, Including the Scripts, are packaged. I put the scripts externally just to allow for easy viewing of my work
